I wanted to do something toward video game trends analysis. On kaggle I had a choice of several datasets.
This was the cleanest one: https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games?select=steam.csv
I was interested in:
  Ratings
  Prices
  Platforms
  Game releases
  
  At first I tried to made the best games by decade, but each would be on seperate page, and I did not like the look. Pluis did not want to have only bar graphs
  Prices were easy enough to compare by years, explenation I could find, other than ressession or whatever, was with the innovations. In my case I had microtransactions. Introduction of this functionality reduced the revenue from the base game sale, or completely eliminated.
  Top 10 was not difficult when calculating number of positive ratings.
  Game releases  were counted from the release of 2003 on each platform for Steam, because the steam did not exist before, and  games were not emulated until then for steam.
  Platforms is an interesting one, because I thought that more Mac users would be now on Steam, but it still appears that the majority is in the hands of Windows. Also good to note that games that are avilable on multiple consoles are counted as a seperate statistic (circle).
